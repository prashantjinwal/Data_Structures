I see, if it's not a complete project but more of a collection of code related to your Data Structures course, you might want to adjust the description accordingly. Here's an updated description:

Semester 2 Data Structures - C++ Practice
Welcome to my Semester 2 Data Structures repository! This is a collection of C++ code snippets and implementations related to the concepts covered in the Data Structures course during my second semester.

Overview
This repository serves as my personal practice ground for mastering data structures using C++. It includes code snippets, small programs, and exercises that I've worked on as part of my learning journey.

Contents
Arrays: Basic array operations and manipulations.

Linked Lists: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.

Trees: Simple binary tree implementations and traversal algorithms.

Graphs: Basic representations and algorithms for graph structures.

Structure
src/: Contains the C++ code for various data structures.

exercises/: Practice exercises and small programs related to data structures.

Usage
Feel free to explore the code for reference or use it as a supplement to your own learning. Each directory within src/ corresponds to a specific data structure or concept.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semester2-data-structures.git
cd semester2-data-structures/src/
I encourage you to adapt and modify the code to enhance your understanding of data structures. If you have questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out.

Happy coding and may your data structures knowledge flourish!
