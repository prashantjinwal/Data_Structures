##Semester 2 Data Structures - 
C++ Practice
Welcome to my Semester 2 Data Structures repository! This is a collection of C++ code snippets and implementations related to the concepts covered in the Data Structures course during my second semester.

Overview
This repository serves as my personal practice ground for mastering data structures using C++. It includes code snippets, small programs, and exercises that I've worked on as part of my learning journey.

Contents
Arrays: Basic array operations and manipulations.

Linked Lists: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.

Trees: Simple binary tree implementations and traversal algorithms.

Graphs: Basic representations and algorithms for graph structures.

Structure
src/: Contains the C++ code for various data structures.

exercises/: Practice exercises and small programs related to data structures.
